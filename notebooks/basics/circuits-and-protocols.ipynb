    "In this section we will introduce the quantum circuit model.\n",

    "To begin, we'll briefly discuss the general notion of a circuit.\n",
    "In this context, the word *circuit* refers to a model of computation in computer science, where information is carried by wires through a network of *gates*, which represent operations that transform the information carried by the wires.\n",
    "Although the word \"circuit\" in English often refers to a circular path through or around something, the use of this terminology to refer to a model of computation is historical in origin: circular paths aren't actually allowed in the most typically studied circuit models of computation.\n",
    "That is to say, we usually study *acyclic circuits* when we're thinking about circuits as computational models, and quantum circuits are no different in this regard; although we can imagine iterating a particular quantum circuit as many times as we would like, a quantum circuit itself represents a finite sequence of operations that can't contain feedback loops."

    "\n",
    "One final remark about the no-cloning theorem is that it really isn't unique to quantum information, it's also impossible to clone an arbitrary probabilistic state using a classical (deterministic or probabilistic) process.\n",

    "Mathematically speaking, a version of the no-cloning theorem for probabilistic states can be proved in exactly the same way as the regular no-cloning theorem (for quantum states).\n",

    "### 3.1 Teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation, or just teleportation for short, is a protocol where a sender (who we will name Alice) transmits a qubit to a receiver (who we will name Bob) by making use of a shared entangled quantum state (one e-bit of entanglement, specifically) along with two bits of classical communication.\n",

    "#### The protocol\n",

    "The set-up is as follows.\n",
    "As the result of something that happened in the past, Alice and Bob are in possession of a shared pair qubits $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ in the $\\vert\\phi^+\\rangle$ state: Alice holds $\\mathsf{X}$ and Bob holds $\\mathsf{Y}$.\n",

    "Or it could be that a different process, such as one involving a third party or a complex distributive process, was used to establish this shared e-bit.\n",
    "These details are not part of the teleportation protocol itself, but rather the protocol considers the shared e-bit as a resource that is available to be used.\n",

    "Alice then comes in possession of a third qubit $\\mathsf{Z}$ that she wishes to transmit to Bob.\n",
    "The state of the qubit $\\mathsf{Z}$ is considered to be *unknown* to Alice and Bob, and no assumptions can be made about it. \n",
    "Indeed, the qubit $\\mathsf{Z}$ might even be entangled with other systems that neither Alice nor Bob can access. \n",
    "To say that Alice wishes to transmit the qubit $\\mathsf{Z}$ to Bob means that Alice would like Bob to be holding a qubit that is in the same state as $\\mathsf{Z}$, having whatever correlations with other systems that $\\mathsf{Z}$ had.\n",

    "### 3.3 The CHSH game\n",
    "\n",
    "The last example we will discuss in this lesson is an example of a game called the CHSH game.\n",
    "It is named after John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt.\n",
    "Although they did not describe it as a game, this is a very natural and intuitive way to view it.\n",
    "Specifically, it is an example of a *cooperative game*, where two individuals (Alice and Bob) work together to achieve a particular outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic assumptions behind the game are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Alice and Bob are in different locations and cannot communicate with one another.\n",
    "   (Perhaps they are on distant planets and the impossibility of faster than light communication denies\n",
    "   them the opportunity to communicate while the game is played.)\n",
    "\n",
    " - They can, however, prepare in advance for the game anyway that they wish, including the possibility that they\n",
    "   share a joint quantum state of two systems and agree on exactly how they will coordinate their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is the CHSH game itself:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Alice is presented with a bit $x$ and Bob is presented with a bit $y$.\n",
    "   Both $x$ and $y$ are generated uniformly at random.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - Alice must respond with a bit $a$ and Bob must respond with a bit $b$.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Alice and Bob win if $a \\oplus b = x \\wedge y$ and they lose if $a \\oplus b \\not= x \\wedge y.$\n",
    "   \n",
    "Just like earlier in the lesson, $a \\oplus b$ is the XOR of $a$ and $b$ and $x\\wedge y$ is the AND of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The challenge for Alice and Bob lies in the fact that $x$ and $y$ are chosen randomly, so despite the fact that they may have coordinated their strategies, neither of them has any knowledge of the bit that the other one received.\n",
    "An alternative way of describing the winning condition is that their answer bits $a$ and $b$ should be equal, except in the case that both $x$ and $y$ are equal to $1$, in which case $a$ and $b$ should not be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think first about *deterministic* strategies for Alice and Bob, where they determine their answers according to functions $a = f(x)$ and $b = g(x)$, there aren't that many possibilities: there are $16$ of them — Alice and Bob each choose one of the four functions from one bit to one bit.\n",
    "Going through them one by one reveals that none of them wins the game every time: for at least one of the four choices of $(x,y)\\in\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\\}$, the answers $a=f(x)$ and $b=g(y)$ will lead to a loss.\n",
    "To be precise, the largest winning probability for any deterministic strategy of the form just described is $3/4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also reason this analytically.\n",
    "Let us assume toward contradiction that there is a deterministic strategy, represented by functions $f$ and $g$ from one bit to one bit as described above, that wins for every $(x,y)\\in\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the strategy wins for $(x,y) = (0,0)$, we see that $f(0) = g(0)$ — Alice and Bob's answers must agree in this case.\n",
    "Similarly, because it wins for $(x,y) = (0,1)$ we conclude $f(0) = g(1)$, and because it wins for $(x,y)=(1,0)$ we conclude $f(1) = g(0)$.\n",
    "Thus, $f(0) = g(0) = f(1) = g(1)$.\n",
    "However, because the strategy wins for $(x,y) = (1,1)$, we conclude that $f(1) \\not= g(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have obtained a contradiction: $f(1) = g(1)$ and $f(1)\\not=g(1)$.\n",
    "That contradiction stemmed from the assumption of a strategy that always wins, and so we conclude that there cannot be such a strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a strategy that wins for three out of the four possible choices of\n",
    "$(x,y)\\in\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\\}$ is one where Alice and Bob both output 0 all of the time, regardless of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "The only input on which this strategy loses is $(x,y) = (1,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a deterministic strategy, where Alice and Bob answer according to functions $f$ and $g$, wins with probability at most $3/4$, and there are strategies that achieve this winning probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "But could a *probabilistic* strategy do better?\n",
    "What we mean is a strategy where Alice and Bob still can't communicate, but where they can use randomness.\n",
    "We also allow them to agree beforehand on a shared random state, meaning that they each have a system and the two systems are somehow randomly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that such a strategy cannot do better.\n",
    "Just like we observed when we remarked that probabilistic operations can be thought of as random choices of deterministic operations in Lesson 1, any sort of probabilistic strategy of the sort just suggested can always be viewed as a random selection of a deterministic strategy.\n",
    "That means we're effectively just averaging over a collection of strategies that each win with probability at most $3/4$, so the end result is that our probabilistic strategy wins with probability at most $3/4$.\n",
    "In simple terms, the average is never larger than the maximum."
